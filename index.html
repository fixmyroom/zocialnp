      <h2>🧍‍♂️ Real Talk from the Guy Who Built This</h2>
      <p>I’m not from IT. I didn’t study computers. I never planned to build an app.</p>
      <p>I just got fed up.</p>
      <p>My room was leaking. My socket was sparking. I called people. They didn’t come. I asked around. No one knew who to trust.</p>
      <p>I felt stuck.</p>
      <p>So I sat down and said, “Fine. I’ll build something myself.”</p>
      <p>I googled. I failed. I tried again. I stayed up nights. I messed up. I kept going.</p>
      <p>Now FixMyRoom exists.</p>
      <p>It’s not perfect. But it works.</p>
      <p>You open it. You ask for help. A real worker shows up. That’s it.</p>
      <p>No middlemen. No fake promises. No BS.</p>
      <p>I’m doing this solo. No team. No investors. Just me, trying to fix what I couldn’t find.</p>
      <p>If you’ve ever felt helpless, this is for you.</p>
      <p><strong>Use it. Share it. Help me keep it alive.</strong></p>
